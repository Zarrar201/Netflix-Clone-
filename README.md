# Netflix-Clone-
I created a basic Netflix clone using only HTML and CSS. This project replicates the look and layout of the Netflix homepage, focusing on structure and visual design without any JavaScript or interactivity.

# Key Features of My Project.
Navigation Bar - Includes the Netflix logo and menu links like Home, TV Shows, Movies, etc.

Hero Section - A large banner with a background image or gradient, promotional text, and a call-to-action button like “Watch Now”.

Content Rows - Multiple horizontal sections with movie/show thumbnails, arranged using CSS Flexbox or Grid.

Footers - Contains helpful links such as FAQ, Terms of Use, and Help Center, styled to match Netflix’s dark theme.
